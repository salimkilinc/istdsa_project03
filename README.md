# istdsa_project03
We have completed our third project as Team-2 in Istanbul Data Science Academy's Data Science Bootcamp. This is my third project where I experienced all the steps of an imbalanced classification project for beginners.

In this project, which we briefly call 'User Type Prediction', citibike® asked us to develop an application that predicts the user type as Subscriber or Customer when some features are entered as input.

You can check out the whole analysis by reviewing the project notebook and the python file or you can read my article on Medium for explanations:

You can also use the model we trained in this project as a streamlit application: https://istdsaproject03.streamlit.app
